# Introduction

In the past years bioinformatics has become a crucial part of several medical laboratories, such as Genetics , Pathology and Medical Microbiology. Hence, bioinformaticians need to comply to both the ISO-15189 and the IVDR. However, the ISO-15189 does not include bioinformatic or software development processes.
Annex I of the IVDR states:
16.2. For devices that incorporate software or for software that are devices in themselves, the software shall be developed and manufactured in accordance with the state of the art taking into account the principles of development life cycle, risk management, including information security, verification and validation.

There is a need for a fieldnorm, that defines what needs to be documented to have bioinformatics as a

The IVDR does not refer to specific standards or norms for software development, however, the IEC-62304 is the harmonized standard for software as a medical device. Following the fieldnorm described here, does not mean compliance to this harmonized standard. But does include the majority of items that need to be documented for a class A Software as a Medical Device.

Within this document, references are made to the ISO-15189:2022. Goals of this fieldnorm: - decrease the documentation burdon - pragmatic solutions - clarity on the working
